Hi everyone! I'm Jaeyeon Kim, a recent graduate with a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Engineering and Philosophy from Seoul National University. I am currently a research intern at the  Seoul National University [Vision and Learning Lab](https://vision.snu.ac.kr/), advised by Professor Gunhee Kim, where I focus on audio-visual learning.

My primary research interests lie in developing artificial intelligence that understand and interact with the world in a human-like manner by integrating multiple modalities, particularly by bridging linguistic and visual knowledge with auditory information.
