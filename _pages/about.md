Hi everyone! I am Jaeyeon Kim, an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science Engineering and Philosophy at Seoul National University. I am currently working as a research intern at the SNU Vision and Learning Lab, where I conduct research on audio-visual learning. Previously, I worked as a research intern at the SNU Music and Audio Research Group. I also served as a Senior Research Scientist at MAUM AI Inc. during my alternative military service, focusing primarily on speech recognition and speech synthesis.

My research interests lie in audio and speech processing, particularly in connecting these areas to different modalities. Additionally, I have a deep interest in Philosophy and in bridging philosophical discussions with artificial intelligence.
