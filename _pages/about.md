Hi everyone! I'm Jaeyeon Kim, an incoming PhD student at the [Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/), starting in Fall 2025. I am currently a research intern at the [Vision and Learning Lab](https://vision.snu.ac.kr/) at Seoul National University, advised by Professor Gunhee Kim, where I focus on audio-multimodal learning.

My primary research interests lie in developing artificial intelligence that understands and interacts with the world in a human-like manner by integrating multiple modalities â€” particularly by bridging linguistic and visual knowledge with auditory information.
