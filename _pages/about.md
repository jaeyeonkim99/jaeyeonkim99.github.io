Hi everyone! I'm Jaeyeon Kim, a PhD student at the [Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/), co-advised by [Professor Carlos Busso](https://carlosbusso.com/) and [Professor Shinji Watanabe](https://sites.google.com/view/shinjiwatanabe). 

My primary research interests lie in developing artificial intelligence that understands and interacts with the world in a human-like manner by integrating multiple modalities â€” particularly by bridging linguistic and visual knowledge with auditory information.
